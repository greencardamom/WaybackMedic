== Notes for running imp.awk ==

The second, it would be good to have a mechanism to mark in the database when a link has been verified, and with a date it was verified. This will allow 
IMP to track links so it doesn't re-verify them later. It also allows IABot to force a link change in the wikitext when there's a discrepancy. This way 
IABot can take over from Medic. Otherwise even if IMP updates the database, IABot won't replace the link in the wikitext if one already exists. So this 
flag tells IABot the database is a more accurate source than the wikitext and it's safe to make the change.

To answer your second query, there is a hidden column in the DB, that has this flag. It's called "reviewed". It's set when the archive URL has been 
modified by a user with the interface or the API. So when GreenC bot is changing archives, it sets the reviewed flag. Also if the archive is removed, by 
a user or API using bot, it will set the reviewed flag. When IABot first sees a URL, it's flag for whether or not it is archived somewhere is set to 
unknown. This flag has it checking the Wayback Machine for one, and if it can't find one, is then set to false. If it does have an archive, it's set to 
true. This is used in the future to determine if an archive exists or not and is what allows IABot to forgo checking the Wayback Machine next time.

HOWEVER, if a user or other bot removes the archive, the "is archived" flag is set to false, and the reviewed flag to true.

When reviewed is set, IABot no longer overwrites the DB entry with something new.

Even on wiki.

*Even if found on wiki, and there is no archive URL associated with it.

Only users can then change that data.

Or bot's using the API.

I believe reviewed isn't indexed./

IABot never forcibly changes archives, unless they are deemed invalid.

This can be overridden in the config, by setting "touch_archives" to 1./

Hope that makes sense. Now what do you need me to do? Jun 5th, 2017 Green_Cardamom 8:43 AM

Re: #2 if IABot can't force a change in wikitext the concept breaks down. The idea was IMP fixes the links in the database and then triggers a run of 
IABot on pages those links exist. But if IABot doesn't force a change nothing happens the wikitext isn't fixed. It might for those with a {{dead link}} 
(additions) but not those requiring delete or modify which is the majority (mostly modify). Cyberpower678 8:45 AM

I've been thinking about adding the option to pass configuration values to bot jobs. That would accomplish your goal.

===Recipes===

. Print URLs in iabget file
    awk -i/home/adminuser/wmnim/wm2/library.awk '{match($0,/[}]archiveurl[=][^{]*[^{]/,dest); 
      dest[0]=strip(subs("}archiveurl=","",dest[0])); if(length(dest[0]) > 0) print dest[0]}' iabget

. Re-do entries in logskindeep with 000000 timestamps

    awk '{print "./iabget -a searchurldata -p urlids=" $1 " >> /home/adminuser/wmnim/wm2/metaimp/dat/imp20180516france1skindeepmd.dat"}' /home/adminuser/wmnim/wm2/metaimp/dat/imp20180516france1skindeepmd.auth

===Instructions===

Consider disabling Runme.robots in medicinit.nim 

If replacing WikiWix (ie. "france" in project name) monitor for non-changes and check why these were not modified by medic

  ./monitor france

----

Download either a "md" or "a" .dat file to ~metaimp/dat

  ./iabget -a searchurldata -p "hasarchive=1" > imp20170708md.dat
  awk '{ if(NF==5) print $0 }' imp20170708md.dat > o ; mv o imp20170708md.dat

  ./iabget -a searchurldata -p "livestate=dead|dying|unknown&isarchived=missing" > imp20170708a.dat
  awk '{ if(NF==5){ if($3 ~ /dead|dying|whitelisted/) print $0 } }' imp20170708a.dat > o ; mv o imp20170708a.dat

You may want to remove any previously processed records ie. auth.impdone.imp20170708a 

 cd static
 ls *.cfg
 copy the last working cfg file to the projectid.cfg 
 modify it

Run IMP:

  ./imp -c <filename.cfg> -r

It will exit to shell when done. Check links as instructed then "exit" back. It will then ask to run API upload
this is a break point. You can cntrl-C out and make changes to imp.cfg or imp.awk then restart. If you say "N" it will 
keep processing the next batch without uploading results to API (recommend). You can then upload results in another 
window while IMP continues processing the next batch.

To upload API results manually run this:

  ./project -e iabget -p <pid>

and/or:

  ./project -e iabget.error -p <pid>

or with -f much faster:

  ./project -f -e iabget.error -p <pid>
