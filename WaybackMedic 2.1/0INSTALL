    lynx          Tested with 2.8.8pre.4
    curl and wget Late models

3. Create two sub-directories "data" and "meta" (eg. mkdir data; mkdir meta)
   Edit project.cfg and update location of these directories. Note to include the trailing "/"
   Create two sub-directories "dataimp" and "metaimp" 
   Edit projimp.cfg and update location of these directories. Note to include the trailing "/"

4. Edit the following files and change the first line hash-bang #!/ to the location of language binary

    *.awk
    modules/*/*.awk
    cloudflare.py and base62.lua 
    All files in ~/scripts 

    Set the above files to executable (eg. chmod 750 iab.awk) 

    Set coldiff script executable

5. Symlinks make life easier:

    ln -s api.awk api
    ln -s bugm.awk bugm
    ln -s driverm.awk driverm
    ln -s iab.awk iab
    ln -s iabget.awk iabget
    ln -s imp.awk imp
    ln -s parallelwatch.awk parallelwatch
    ln -s projectm.awk projectm
    ln -s runmedic.awk runmedic

    Note: some end in "m" (bugm) to differentiate from the versions installed with BotWikiAwk
          the "m" versions are customized for WaybackMedic

6. Clone and install BotWikiAwk

    A. Clone: https://github.com/greencardamom/BotWikiAwk
    B. Follow install directions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GreenC/BotWikiAwk
    C. Replace the default ~/botwikiawk/lib/botwiki.awk with the version included with WaybackMedic. 
         Update any hard-coded paths in botwiki.awk for your system
    D. 'wikiget' should be installed with BotWikiAwk (log out of window and back in, check paths) 
       If not, see https://github.com/greencardamom/Wikiget and install
       You will need Oauth credentials see instructions for wikiget. 
       You will need a bot account with botflag permissions.

6A. Fix paths

    Edit ~/scripts/push and change the hard-coded path

    Edit medicinit.nim and set these paths (customize):
      GX.home = "/home/adminuser/wm21/"
      putEnv("SLIMERJSLAUNCHER","/home/adminuser/firefox58/firefox")

      (the "firefox" is the binary location of firefox on the system)

    Edit 0RUN and change hard-coded paths

7. Install Slimerjs and Phantomjs for robots.txt checking

    Install these two headless browsers which require Node.js
    Edit medicapi.nim locate "commandPhantom" and "commandFirefox" and update hard paths to these programs

8. Install Cloudflare for bypassing bot checkers

    https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape

9. Compile medic.nim - this is the core program for processing a single article.

	nim c medic.nim

Follow directions for running see file 0RUN
