Bot Modules  

==Install==

Requires a BotWikiAwk install

==Running==

Can be run as a stand-alone bot, or as part of WaybackMedic via modules.nim

To run as standalone, use BotWikiAwk commands: project, runbot, bug

Either way it's the same code with no changes ie. wam.awk works without modification either 
running from the command-line or called from WaybackMedic as a script.
