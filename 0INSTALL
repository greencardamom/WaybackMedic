Instructions for installing WaybackMedic and configuring AWB 

== WaybackMedic ==

1. Download all WaybackMedic files to a directory (eg. /home/user/wm)

2. The following programs are required:

    Nim           Install development release instructions here: http://howistart.org/posts/nim/1
    GNU Awk 4.1+
    GNU Parallel 
    wdiff         (for colored inline diffs - apt-get install wdiff) (optional)
    
2. Create two sub-directories "data" and "meta" (eg. mkdir data; mkdir meta)

3. Edit the following files and change the first line hash-bang #!/ to the location of GNU Awk    

    ucontribs.awk
    project.awk
    bug.awk
    driver.awk

    Set the above files to executable (eg. chmod 750 ucontribs.awk) 
    Set coldiff script executable

4. Symlinks to make life easier:

    ln -s ucontribs.awk ucon
    ln -s project.awk project
    ln -s bug.awk bug
    ln -s driver.awk driver

5. Edit init.awk and set paths to programs 

6. Compile medic.nim

	nim c medic.nim

== Configure AWB ==

7. WaybackMedic uses AWB's Tools->External process feature. The external process will be GNU Awk.

   You have a choice which GNU Awk to run under Windows.

     1. Cygwin
     2. Native precompiled Windows binary

   1. If using Cygwin (recommend) install Cygwin and Awk will be included as a POSIX standard tool.
   2. A native precompiled binary is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/?source=navbar
        This binary is compiled and maintained by the GNU development team and is recommended by them as safe.

      Note: I have not tested with native windows binary - it may require changes to paths "/" vs "\" 

8. AWB configuration (awb-settings.xml) for Cygwin would look something like this:

    <ExternalProgram>
      <Enabled>true</Enabled>
      <Skip>true</Skip>
      <Program>c:\cygwin\bin\gawk.exe</Program>
      <Parameters>-f /home/name/wm/demon-win.awk "%%title%%"</Parameters>
      <PassAsFile>true</PassAsFile>
      <OutputFile>h:\article.txt</OutputFile>
    </ExternalProgram>

  The path of the OutputFile will match the path of "Ramdisk" set in step 5
  It doesn't have to be an actual ramdisk, "c:\tmp\" will also work here, in init.awk it would be "/tmp/"
  Mindful of "/" and "\" in the above as they are a mix

9. Edit demon-win.awk and change the paths in the 3 lines marked Configuration at the top

10. The purpose of the two demon-* scripts is explained here ("Method 2")

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Green_Cardamom/awb/cygwin

   They were created to allow running medic in a VirtualBox Linux machine and AWB native under Windows. However they 
   can also work with AWB running under Wine on Linux, or AWB on Windows and medic running in Cygwin.
